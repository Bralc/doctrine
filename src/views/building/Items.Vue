        <p>Items are objects that can be interacted with in game. They can be carried, equipped, dropped in a room, and be used as quest objectives or rewards.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Naming</div>

        <p>A best practice when naming items is to start the item name with a lowercase article, for example 'a rock'. This will ensure that when the game constructs sentences with the item, the syntax is correct.</p>

        <p>For example, 'You pick up a rock.' is a correct english sentence. If the item is named 'Big Rock', the game will print 'You pick up Big Rock.'. This can be a desired effect every once in a while, but most of the time a lowercased article should be used.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Stats</div>

        <p>Equippable items can be worn on equipment slots, as long as the item's level is not more than 3 above that of the wearer.</p>

        <p>Equippable items can also grant bonuses to the stats of the wearer, and those are referred to as 'imbued'. They appear in yellow in game.</p>

        <p>When an item is imbued, it will be given a 'Item Power' percentage in the Stats Bonuses panel on the right-hand side of the item management screen. This indicator represents how strong this item's stat bonuses are compared to a randomly generated item of the same level.</p>

        <p>Items that have an item power greater than 120% are referred to as 'enchanted'. They receive a 20% bonus to armor and damage.</p>

        <p>Equippable items automatically grant armor, proportionally to the items's level, quality (normal &amp; imbued vs enchanted), and its armor class. Items of the 'heavy' armor class grant 4 times more armor than regular items, but can only be worn by warriors or classless players with the <code>proficiency_heavy_armor</code> mark.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Item Loading</div>

        <p>Items can either be loaded on the ground in a room, or in a character's inventory, or in another item. If an item loads in a mob's inventory and is equippable, the mob will automatically equip it.</p>

        <p>For items loaded on characters, they can be loaded in two ways:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            By selecting the item as part of a mob template's inventory. This will make the mob
            <em>always</em> load that item.
          </li>
          <li>By adding a loader rule that targets the output of a mob loading rule. This will make the mob load the item every time the rule is run.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Items can be loaded in other items via loaders, by having a rule target the output of a previous item loading rule.</p>

        <p>Items can be loaded directly on the ground via loaders, either in a specific room if that is the selected target or in a random room within a zone or path if those are targeted.</p>

        <p>When an item is loaded to the ground, picking it up will queue another item load to replace it, if the loader is set to respawn.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">On Use</div>

        <p>Items have an 'On Use' action triggered with the syntax <code>use &lt;item_name&gt;</code>. The item's on use commands as well as its description shown in item lookups is in the Advanced section of the Item Template screen in the world editor.</p>

        <p>Note: <code>use</code> invokes a room command in the room where the item is.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Random Items</div>

        <p>Creating equipment items can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially if you are trying to establish a careful balance. To help with this, the world editor offers an option to automatically generate equipment.</p>

        <p>Random items are enabled in the mob template screen, by checking the 'Load Random Items' in the 'Load Items' section. You can then select how many items to load, which will be of the same level as the mob.</p>

        <p>Random items can be restricted to only generate certain equipment slots, for example weapons or helmets.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Item Upgrades</div>

        <p>Items that are imbued or enchanted can be upgraded by upgrader mobs. Mobs can be set as upgraders in the Mob Template screen, for which you can tweak the cost multplier, success chance, success reactions and failure reactions.</p>

        <p>When an upgrade fails, the item is destroyed and the cost is refunded. If the upgrade succeeds, the item's stats are boosted by 20%.</p>

        <p>Imbued items can be upgraded once and enchanted items can be upgraded up to 3 times.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Containers</div>

        <p>Containers can hold up to 10 different items, and 30 copies of each item. They cannot hold other containers. </p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Boats</div>

        <p>By selecting 'Allows to go on water' in the item template, characters can use this item to travel on water. Shallow water tiles don't require boats.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Trash</div>

        <p>Trash are containers which deletes any items placed in them.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Augments</div>

        <p>Augments are upgrade components that can be applied to imbued and enchanted items. They have stats which boosts the item's stats upon use. Augmenting an already augmented item will destroy the previous augment.</p>

        <p>Augment stats can be set in the Stat Bonuses panel on the right-hand side of the item management screen.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Consumables or Food</div>

        <p>Consumables or food are items that can be eaten or drank by characters to restore a certain amount of health, mana or stamina. They can be expended whilst in combat</p>
